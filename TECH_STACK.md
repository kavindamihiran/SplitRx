# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Welcome to the technical overview of **SplitRx**. This document is designed to be readable by everyone—from non-technical stakeholders to experienced engineers.

## 🟢 For Everyone (Beginner Friendly)

Think of this application like a **modern, secure pharmacy**.

### 1. The Storefront (Frontend)

**Technology:** Next.js & React
This is what you see and interact with. Just like a modern store has a clean layout, shelves, and a checkout counter, our specific "storefront" is built to be fast, responsive on mobile phones, and easy to use.

- **What it does:** Shows you the dashboard, lets doctors write prescriptions, and allows pharmacists to scan codes.

### 2. The Brain (Backend)

**Technology:** Node.js & Express
This is the manager in the back office. When you click "Submit Prescription," the Storefront talks to the Brain.

- **What it does:** Checks if you are allowed to do that action, validates that the data is correct, and decides where to file the information.

### 3. The Filling Cabinet (Database)

**Technology:** PostgreSQL
This is where all the records are kept safe. It's not just a stack of papers; it's a high-speed, organized vault.

- **What it does:** Stores user accounts, prescription details, and the secure audit logs that prove no one tampered with the data.

### 4. The Shipping Container (Infrastructure)

**Technology:** Docker
Imagine being able to pick up the entire pharmacy—building, shelves, medicine, and staff—and move it to any city in the world instantly. That's what Docker does.

- **What it does:** Packages the whole application so it runs exactly the same way on a developer's laptop as it does on the cloud servers.
